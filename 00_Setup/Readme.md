## Open the Console
*Note:* By default the console is only accessible to localhost. If you need to access it remotely edit conf/default.js
```
...
// The hostnames or IPs from which connections to admin are allowed. Hostnames must be resolvable on the
// server. IP ranges can also be specified. e.g. [ 'localhost', '192.168.1.0/24', '10.1.1.1' ]
// An empty list [] will allow unrestricted access, though this is not recommended due to security concerns.
allowedHosts: [
	'localhost', '::1'
],
...
```

In your favourite browser open http://localhost:8080/console. If you're not already authenitcated to the Axway Platform then you will be redirected.
*Note:* if you're note accessing the console via _localhost_ then the Platform login will not redirect back to console and you will have to enter http://localhost:8080/console again.
